*Purpose*: When designing structures such as bridges, boats, and planes,
the design team needs data about *material properties*. Often when we
engineers first learn about material properties through coursework, we
talk about abstract ideas and look up values in tables without ever
looking at the data that gave rise to published properties. In this
challenge you’ll study an aluminum alloy dataset: Studying these data
will give you a better sense of the challenges underlying published
material values.

In this challenge, you will load a real dataset, wrangle it into tidy
form, and perform EDA to learn more about the data.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

*Background*: In 1946, scientists at the Bureau of Standards tested a
number of Aluminum plates to determine their
[elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus) and
[Poisson’s ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio).
These are key quantities used in the design of structural members, such
as aircraft skin under [buckling
loads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling). These scientists tested
plats of various thicknesses, and at different angles with respect to
the [rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_(metalworking))
direction.

# Loading and Wrangle

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

The `readr` package in the Tidyverse contains functions to load data
form many sources. The `read_csv()` function will help us load the data
for this challenge.

``` r
## NOTE: If you extracted all challenges to the same location,
## you shouldn't have to change this filename
filename <- "./data/stang.csv"

## Load the data
df_stang <- read_csv(filename)
```

    ## Rows: 9 Columns: 8
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): alloy
    ## dbl (7): thick, E_00, mu_00, E_45, mu_45, E_90, mu_90
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
df_stang
```

    ## # A tibble: 9 × 8
    ##   thick  E_00 mu_00  E_45  mu_45  E_90 mu_90 alloy  
    ##   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>

    ## 9 0.081 10000 0.311    -1 -1      9900 0.314 al_24st

Note that these data are not tidy! The data in this form are convenient
for reporting in a table, but are not ideal for analysis.

### **q1** Tidy `df_stang` to produce `df_stang_long`. You should have column names `thick, alloy, angle, E, nu`. Make sure the `angle` variable is of correct type. Filter out any invalid values.

*Hint*: You can reshape in one `pivot` using the `".value"` special
value for `names_to`.

``` r
## TASK: Tidy `df_stang`
df_stang_long <-
  df_stang %>%
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = c(".value", "angle"),
    names_sep = "_",
    cols = c(E_00, mu_00, E_45, mu_45, E_90, mu_90)
  ) %>%
  filter(E > 0) %>%
  rename(nu = mu) %>%
  type.convert(as.is = TRUE)

df_stang_long
```

    ## # A tibble: 26 × 5
    ##    thick alloy   angle     E    nu
    ##    <dbl> <chr>   <int> <int> <dbl>
    ##  1 0.022 al_24st     0 10600 0.321
    ##  2 0.022 al_24st    45 10700 0.329
    ##  3 0.022 al_24st    90 10500 0.31 
    ##  4 0.022 al_24st     0 10600 0.323
    ##  5 0.022 al_24st    45 10500 0.331
    ##  6 0.022 al_24st    90 10700 0.323
    ##  7 0.032 al_24st     0 10400 0.329
    ##  8 0.032 al_24st    45 10400 0.318
    ##  9 0.032 al_24st    90 10300 0.322
    ## 10 0.032 al_24st     0 10300 0.319
    ## # … with 16 more rows

**Observations**:

- Is there “one true value” for the material properties of Aluminum?
  - No; all of the properties have some spread
- How many aluminum alloys are in this dataset? How do you know?
  - Just 1, since in the `alloy` column there is only one repeating
    alloy listed: `al_24st`
- What angles were tested?
  - 0, 45, and 90 degrees
- What thicknesses were tested?
  - 0.022, 0.032, 0.064, and 0.081 of whatever unit the data uses
- What is the relationship between the aluminum `thickness` and the
  measured `E`?

## Visualize

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q3** Create a visualization to investigate your question from q2 above. Can you find an answer to your question using the dataset? Would you need additional information to answer your question?

``` r
ggplot(data = df_stang_long) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = thick, y = E, group = cut_width(thick, width = 0.01)))
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- There doesn’t appear to be a clear linear correlation between
  thickness and E (elasticity). However, the elasticities tend to
  coagulate into the same range of values for each sample thickness.
  Because of this pattern, it appears that there is a relationship
  between thickness and modulus of elasticity, but this relationship is
  more complex than a simple linear regression line could determine.

### **q4** Consider the following statement:

“A material’s property (or material property) is an intensive property
of some material, i.e. a physical property that does not depend on the
amount of the material.”\[2\]

Note that the “amount of material” would vary with the thickness of a
tested plate. Does the following graph support or contradict the claim
that “elasticity `E` is an intensive material property.” Why or why not?
Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another? Why or why not?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change; run this chunk
df_stang_long %>%

  ggplot(aes(nu, E, color = as_factor(thick))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-vis-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Does this graph support or contradict the claim above?
  - This graph contradicts the claim, as it appears that a relation
    exists where a greater thickness correlates with a smaller `nu` and
    `E`. For example, all of the data gathered from thicknesses of 0.081
    (the greatest thickness measured) is concentrated at the bottom left
    of the graph, while the data trends towards the upper right of the
    graph as the thicknesses get smaller. Because the elasticity `E`
    generally changes with thickness, then this graph contradicts the
    claim that the elasticity is an intensive material property.
  - This evidence is not super conclusive, because there are a lot of
    unknowns that could possibly be skewing data. For example, it is
    possible that the material analysis tool used to measure the
    elasticity was designed in a way that changes in dimensions/geometry
    might affect the measurements. That is a reason why dogbone shapes
    are common in tension tests.
